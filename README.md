## üöÄ Overview

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is rapidly becoming the standard for connecting AI agents to external services. This project implements an MCP server for [Recruitee](https://recruitee.com/), enabling advanced, AI-powered search, filtering, and reporting on recruitment data.

Unlike basic CRUD wrappers, this server focuses on the tasks where LLMs and AI agents excel: **summarizing, searching, and filtering**. It exposes a set of tools and prompt templates, making it easy for any MCP-compatible client to interact with Recruitee data in a structured, agent-friendly way.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Advanced Candidate Search & Filtering**  
  Search for candidates by skills, status, talent pool, job, tags, and more. Example:  
  _"Find candidates with Elixir experience who were rejected due to salary expectations."_

- **Recruitment Summary Reports**  
  Generate summaries of recruitment activities, such as time spent in each stage, total process duration, and stage-by-stage breakdowns.

- **Recruitment Statistics**  
  Calculate averages and metrics (e.g., average expected salary for backend roles, average time to hire, contract type stats).

- **General Search**  
  Quickly find candidates, recruitments, or talent pools by name or attribute.

- **GDPR Compliance**  
  (Planned) Automatic deletion of personal data after 2 years, configurable per talent pool or recruitment.

- **Prompt Templates**  
  Exposes prompt templates for LLM-based clients, ensuring consistent and high-quality summaries.

## üõ† Example Queries

- _Find candidates with Elixir experience who were rejected due to salary expectations._
- _Show me their personal details including CV URL._
- _Why was candidate 'X' disqualified and at what stage?_
- _What are the other stages for this offer?_

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Implementation

- **Language:** Python
- **Framework:** [FastMCP](https://github.com/chrishayuk/fastmcp)
- **API:** [Recruitee Careers Site API](https://docs.recruitee.com/reference/intro-to-careers-site-api)
- **Schemas:** All MCP tool schemas are generated from Pydantic models, with rich metadata for LLMs.

The server retrieves and processes data from Recruitee, exposing it via MCP tools. Summaries are composed by the client using provided prompt templates.

## üö¶ Transport Methods

- **stdio** ‚Äì For local development and testing.
- **streamable-http** ‚Äì For remote, production-grade deployments (recommended).
- **SSE** ‚Äì Supported but deprecated in some MCP frameworks.

## üß™ Usage

### Local (stdio)

1. **Configure your MCP client:**

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "recruitee": {
          "command": "/path/to/.venv/bin/python",
          "args": ["/path/to/recruitee-mcp-server/app/app.py", "--transport", "stdio"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

2. **Run with [mcp-cli](https://github.com/chrishayuk/mcp-cli):**

    ```bash
    mcp-cli chat --server recruitee --config-file /path/to/mcp-cli/server_config.json
    ```

### Remote (streamable-http)

1. **Configure your MCP client:**

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "recruitee": {
          "transport": "streamable-http",
          "url": "https://recruitee-mcp-server.fly.dev/mcp"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

2. **Or use [mcp-remote](https://github.com/chrishayuk/mcp-remote) for free-tier clients:**

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "recruitee": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "mcp-remote",
            "https://recruitee-mcp-server.fly.dev/mcp/"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

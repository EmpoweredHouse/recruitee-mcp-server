## üöÄ Overview

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is rapidly becoming the standard for connecting AI agents to external services. This project implements an MCP server for [Recruitee](https://recruitee.com/), enabling advanced, AI-powered search, filtering, and reporting on recruitment data.

Unlike basic CRUD wrappers, this server focuses on the tasks where LLMs and AI agents excel: **summarizing, searching, and filtering**. It exposes a set of tools and prompt templates, making it easy for any MCP-compatible client to interact with Recruitee data in a structured, agent-friendly way.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Implementation

- **Language:** Python
- **Framework:** [FastMCP](https://github.com/chrishayuk/fastmcp)
- **API:** [Recruitee Careers Site API](https://docs.recruitee.com/reference/intro-to-careers-site-api)
- **Schemas:** All MCP tool schemas are generated from Pydantic models, with rich metadata for LLMs.

The server retrieves and processes data from Recruitee, exposing it via MCP tools. Summaries are composed by the client using provided prompt templates.

## üö¶ Transport Methods

- **stdio** ‚Äì For local development and testing.
- **streamable-http** ‚Äì For remote, production-grade deployments (recommended).
- **SSE** ‚Äì Supported but deprecated in some MCP frameworks.

## üß™ Usage
üí° **Tip:** For data visualization, combine this with chart-specific MCP servers like [mcp-server-chart](https://github.com/antvis/mcp-server-chart)

### Local (stdio)

1. **Configure your MCP client:**

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "recruitee": {
          "command": "/path/to/.venv/bin/python",
          "args": ["/path/to/recruitee-mcp-server/src/app.py", "--transport", "stdio"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

2. **Run with [mcp-cli](https://github.com/chrishayuk/mcp-cli):**

    ```bash
    mcp-cli chat --server recruitee --config-file /path/to/mcp-cli/server_config.json
    ```

### Remote (streamable-http)
1. **Use [mcp-remote](https://github.com/chrishayuk/mcp-remote):**

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "recruitee": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "mcp-remote",
            "https://recruitee-mcp-server.fly.dev/mcp/",
            "--header",
            "Authorization: Bearer ${MCP_BEARER_TOKEN}"
          ],
          "env": {
            "MCP_BEARER_TOKEN": "KEY"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```


2. **or use directly if client supports bearer token authorization**

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "recruitee": {
          "transport": "streamable-http",
          "url": "https://recruitee-mcp-server.fly.dev/mcp"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

### Deploy to Fly.io

1. **Set your secrets in `.env`**
2. **Create a volume**
    ```bash
    make create_volume
    ```
3. **Deploy:**

    ```bash
    flyctl auth login
    make deploy
    ```
